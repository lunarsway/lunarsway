%p
  %strong LUNAR SWAY
  is
  %i energy, urgency and a message.

%p The group is guided by the underlying principle of change and progress: political, environmental, personal and musical.
%p It starts with the courage to actively observe our culture and the current state of our society and reflect the realities back to create awareness through music.
%p
  Being aware of the truths of issues like global warming is the first step necessary for change just as being aware of our deeper, personal
  truths is the first step in becoming a better human being. It takes a certain fearlessness to stand up and tell your truth and it takes even more
  courage to take steps toward change.

  Embracing new models of creation, promotion and distribution of their music, Lunar Sway draws on traditional and popular styles to create a
  sound that is uniquely their own. By choice, the group is self-produced, self-managed and controls all aspects of their distribution.
%p In more ways than one, the moon is tied to Lunar Sway and Lunar Sway is tied to the moonâ€¦
%p The moon never rests. It moves with a concentrated energy, always at work, although sometimes invisible to the naked eye.
%p Then for one day each month, it glares brilliantly with all of its reflective glory, one moment of clarity disproving the illusion that it was ever less than whole.
%p The moon shifts every day, knowing it has a purpose, determined to leave everything just a little different than the moment before. Every day, a little more progress.
