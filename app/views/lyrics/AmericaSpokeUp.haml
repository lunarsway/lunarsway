  Lighthouse keeper - where have you been?
  %br/
  This broken beacon - been shinning dim
  %br/
  Steeples rise - into a damaged sky
  %br/
  with people praying - for a change inside

%p
  The crowds - the crowds are swarming
  %br/
  It's the sound - of moving forward
  %br/
  Well the sea is a changin' - the sailing has been rough
  %br/
  I heard that fear was on the run

%p America Spoke Up

%p
  Well there's been no music at the school in a while
  %br/
  and there's raindrops falling from the cieling tiles
  %br/
  Well a mother moved into her daughter's house
  %br/
  She had to sell her place when her health went south

%p
  I don't want my son - sweeping the ashes of our dreams
  %br/
  I don't want our daughters - asking why we let this be

%p
  The crowds - the crowds are swarming
  %br/
  It's the sound - of moving forward
  %br/
  Well the sea is a changin' - the sailing has been rough
  %br/
  I heard that fear was on the run
  %br/
  and that your hope had nearly turned to dust
  %br/
  let's give them something they can trust

%p America Spoke Up
